This application allows users to scrape headlines from the New York Times using the Node.js Cheerio and Request packages. The front-end utilizes Bootstrap and jQuery. Click on the Scrape New Articles! button to retreive new articles and the number of articles will be displayed in the status. If the app is already up-to-date with the latest headlines, the status will display 'No new articles at this time.' Click the headline to follow the link to the New York Times article.
